# Djafar Moussa — Industrial Bioengineering Student | Aspiring Computational Neuroscientist

I’m a third-year industrial bioengineering student at INSAT, currently building a self-directed journey into computational neuroscience. This profile is a live documentation of the process.

---

##  Mission  
My long-term goal is to build new fundamental ways of approaching science.

---

##  Vision  
The balance has changed compared to the last century, our approach to science has and is changing, the modern dilemma is no longer concentrated on finding ways to acquire data but rather to make meaning of the overwhelming quantity of complex data that we have today thus my current focus to master this field of analysis and build computational models that could potentially help solve long pondered questions about the brain.

## Timeline  
By 2027, I aim to reach a functional enough fluency in the theoretical and technical foundations of computational neuroscience to begin contributing to the global scientific community. Every step of this journey is being documented in the [recipe-book](https://github.com/Djafar105/Recipe_Book) repository.

##  Motivation for Public Documentation  
I chose to do this via GitHub for its version control—my recent favorite discovery—as it allows for a 4D workflow.  
More importantly, this platform enables me to validate and make my process credible, especially as an independent learner outside the traditional academic tracks of learning neuroscience.

##  Audience  
This project is first for my future versions of myself—serving as a reflective tool and an archive of thought/patterns and knowledge.But it is also for all the humans with a chaotic curiosity and a desire to learn.
